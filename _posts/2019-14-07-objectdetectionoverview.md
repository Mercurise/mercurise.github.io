Here are some basic contents/

And here are some *italics*

Here are some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/Mercurise/)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np
    def test_function(x,y):
        z = np.sum(x,y)
        return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here are some inline code 'x+y'

Here is an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/object-detection/temp2.png" alt="temp images of object detection">


Here is another using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg)

Here are some math:
$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
